# 🚗 Nigeria Car Market Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 1. Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the Nigerian car market to uncover key trends and insights about consumer behavior, car brand preferences, vehicle conditions, and geographic demand. The dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders—including auto dealers, marketers, and researchers—with actionable intelligence for informed decision-making.

## 📊 2. Dataset Details

- **Source**: Simulated dataset representing Nigerian automobile market data.
- **Data Points Included**:
  - Car brand and model
  - Transmission type (automatic/manual)
  - Price
  - Engine capacity
  - Mileage (in km)
  - Horsepower (hp)
  - Car condition (brand new, foreign used, Nigerian used)
  - Car color
  - Geographic location (state-level)

## 🛠 3. Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – For building interactive dashboards and performing data transformation.
- **Microsoft Excel** – For preliminary data cleaning and formatting.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For creating calculated metrics and aggregations.

## ⚙️ 4. Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Import**: Loaded cleaned dataset into Power BI.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Removed null and duplicate values
   - Created new columns for key metrics (e.g., average price, average engine size)
3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Defined appropriate relationships between fields
   - Created measures for summarization (total cars by brand, color, etc.)
4. **Visualization**:
   - Built visual components to showcase brand popularity, user preference, car colors, and regional demand

## 🔍 5. Key Insights

- **Toyota** is the leading brand in Nigeria with 1,126 cars, followed by **Honda** and **Lexus**.
- Over **94%** of Nigerian drivers prefer **automatic transmission**.
- **Black**, **Silver**, and **Gray** are the top three car colors of choice.
- The **average price** of a car in Nigeria is around **₦5 million**.
- Most vehicles have around **28,000 horsepower**, **217 km mileage**, and **3.1K cc engine size**.
- **Southwestern Nigeria**, especially Lagos and surrounding areas, has the highest car concentration.

## 📊 6. Visualization

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

- Top 10 most popular car brands
- Distribution of automatic vs manual transmission
- Most demanded car colors
- State-wise car demand map of Nigeria
- Key vehicle metrics (price, horsepower, mileage, engine capacity)
- Filters for car condition: Brand New, Foreign Used, Nigerian Used

## 💡 7. Recommendations

- Auto dealers should prioritize stocking **Toyota**, **Honda**, and **Lexus** models.
- Vehicles with **automatic transmission** and **black/silver** color schemes will likely yield higher sales.

- Does not include year of manufacture, car condition scores, or user demographic data.
- No data on resale value, ownership history, or maintenance frequency.

## 🔄 9. Next Steps 

- Integrate real-time car listing datasets from local platforms like Jiji and Cars45.
- Add additional features such as vehicle age, service history, and buyer demographics.
- Publish to Power BI Service for live dashboard sharing and scheduled refresh.
- Expand the analysis to other African markets for cross-regional insights.
